We continue working on the "Mesto" project.</br>

The website is now connected to the server, and semantic props have been added. The code has been refactored using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project has been built using webpack. The project is written in three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Form validation has been implemented using JS. The website is styled with adaptability and responsiveness to different screen formats. Block and element naming follow the BEM methodology, and the files are structured using the BEM Nested methodology.</br>
